# What Is This?
The StoryTime Application for Web Browsers.  Allows anyone with a modern browser
(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to play StoryTime.  Have fun!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Literally thousands of software developers have delivered working code that enables
this game to exist.  This app is merely an arrangement of frosting on the giant
layer cake of code.  Big thanks to the open source community.
