      summary: Updates a signpost on a scene for a story in draft mode.
      description: Updates a signpost on a scene for a story in draft mode.  This method handles all of the ways to modify a signpost.  Including a new destination in toUpdate will create a new sign.  Including an existing destination will update the sign.  Adding a destination to the toDelete array will remove the sign.  Removal happens first, but there is no need to remove a destination that is being updated.  It will simply be recreated.  If you are trying to remove a destination, be sure not to update it in the same call.
