      "prose": "You are 10 years old.  You are no ordinary 10-year old.  You are a trusted agent of an elite spy network, and you are on a mission to recover the golden bars from a high-security warehouse in a location that you know only too well.  The mission leader has equipped you with a handful of ancient coins and notes that are used by the locals of this region to exchange for valuables.  Your mission is to enter the warehouse, locate the Golden Bars, bribe the security guard, and return to Command Central.\nShould you be captured in pursuit of your mission, there is no telling what foul consequences await you.  It is best not to be seen.  Your knack for blending in and ability to disappear in a whisper are, without a doubt, why you were chosen for this mission.\nAs you dismount the stairs that lead from headquarters to the main street, you face your first decision.  Should you play it cool and loose and head down the street directly toward your objective?  Or would it be better to sneak around to the back and take the Forgotten Trail?",

A few cars pass by up and down the two-lane street.  The usual.\nOn the next block, you bump into some friends of yours, Bob and Angel.  You go to school together, but that’s not the half of it.  They are also members of the spy network.  In fact, for your last mission, the three of you invaded Sky Tower and brought back crucial intelligence that led to the take-down of The Big Ugly.

Bravely, you approach the entrance of the warehouse, glance left and right, and step through the broad, inviting doors knowing only too well that this might be a trap.\nThe warehouse is surprisingly well lit.  As you glance across the aisles, you notice that each is labeled.  It seems that someone has grouped the items in storage by category: bread, baking,  canned goods.  You remember that the golden bars are kept somewhere along the warehouse walls: produce, meat, dairy.  Eureka, you have found the golden bars.  2 packages, that’s what the Supreme Commander instructed.  You grab the bars and head for the front to make your escape.\nSure enough, you are going to have to get past the guards.  You put the packages of Golden Bars on the beltway for scanning, reach into your pocket, and hand the guard the ancient coins and notes.  She returns some of the coins along with a slip of paper, no doubt an encrypted message for the Supreme Commander.  You put the coins and message into your pocket while the guard hides the golden bars in a plain paper sack.  Good idea.  You wouldn’t want anyone to know what you are carrying.\nAs you leave the warehouse, it occurs to you that you might have been followed.  Perhaps you should take a different route back to Command Central.",

You hand her the satchel with the golden bars and start to head for the spy lounge when she asks if you have any leftover coins.  This commander sure runs a tight ship.  You hand her what’s in your pocket and dash for the lounge, where you flip on the televisor, grab a control set, and get back to playing your favorite game, [i]Spy Lords of the Multiverse[/i].\nAfter an hour that passes in an instant, you break to enjoy some fresh butter cookies and milk.

On occasion, you have found a few rusty 10-inch spikes, no doubt the preferred tool of the ancients for hunting.  Today the path is clear.\nWalking down the Forgotten Trail, you approach one of your favorite outposts, the Sky Tower.  From there you can get the lay of the land, and watch the locals going about their business.  It occurs to you that it would be a good idea to see who is about.  You want to avoid contact with any counter-agents.\nSo you climb the ladder that leads to Sky Tower and push open the trapdoor.  The Tower is empty.  From its windows, you see the backside of Headquarters along with other buildings.  You can also see the back of the warehouse, where people are coming and going.  Next to the warehouse is the Jewel Emporium.  Standing outside the Emporium, you spot two agents in your spy network.  They must be on a mission of their own.  The building is blocking your view, so it is difficult to make out what they are up to.\nOutside a window of Sky Tower, there is a pole that reaches to the right.

Next to the Emporium is the warehouse, the target of your mission.\nAlthough the mission is important, you cannot help but think of the treasures in the Emporium, and you wonder about the mission of your fellow spies.

The pole gives a little as you slide farther out, just a bit more to see what’s happening.\nYour brain whirs into high gear as you realize you have gone too far and lose your grip.  As you fall, your cat-like reflexes help you twist, and when you hit the ground you roll just a bit.  Although you have prevented the worst, your left ankle took most of the weight of impact.\nKnowing defeat when it snears in your face, you hobble back to Headquarters.  The Supreme Commander pulls an ice pack from cold storage and applies it to your ankle that is now the size of a grapefruit.  There may be a trip to the medic in your future.\nUntil then, you get to sit in front of the spy lounge televisor and play your favorite game, [i]Spy Lords of the Multiverse[/i].
