You are a trusted agent of an elite spy network, and you are on a mission to recover the Golden Bars from a high-security warehouse in a location that you know only too well.  The Supreme Commander has equipped you with a handful of coins and notes that are used by the locals of this region to exchange for valuables.  Your mission is to enter the warehouse, locate the Golden Bars, bribe the security guard, and return to Headquarters.\nShould you be captured in pursuit of your mission, there is no telling what foul consequences await you.  It is best not to be seen.  Your knack for blending in and ability to disappear in a whisper are, without a doubt, why you were chosen for this mission.\nAs you dismount the stairs that lead from Headquarters to the main street, you face your first decision.  Should you head down the street toward your objective or sneak around to the back and take the Forgotten Trail?",

A few cars pass by up and down the slow, two-lane street. The usual.\nOn the next block, you bump into some friends of yours, Bob and Angel. You go to school together, but that’s not the half of it. They are also agents in your spy network. In fact, for your last mission, the three of you invaded Sky Tower and brought back crucial intelligence that led to the take-down of The Big Ugly. But that’s a story for another day.\nToday, Bob and Angel are on a mission of their own, to liberate the Jewels of Rockland. They invite you to join them. The reward will be sweet.",

Bravely, you approach the entrance of the warehouse, glance left and right, and step through the broad, inviting doors knowing only too well that this might be a trap.\nThe warehouse is surprisingly well lit. As you glance across the aisles, you notice that each is labeled. It seems that someone has grouped the items in storage by category: bread, baking,  canned goods, and so on. You remember that the Golden Bars are kept along the outer walls that are also labeled: produce, meat, dairy. Eureka, you have found the Golden Bars. 2 packages will do. Now to make your escape.\nSure enough, as you approach the exit, you see that you are going to have to get past the guards. Placing the packages of Golden Bars on the beltway for a scanning, you reach into your pocket, and hand the guard the coins and notes. She returns some of the coins along with a slip of paper, no doubt an encrypted message for the Supreme Commander. The coins and message go into your pocket while the guard hides the Golden Bars in a plain paper sack.  Good thinking.  You wouldn’t want anyone to know what you are carrying.\nAs you leave the warehouse, it occurs to you that you might have been spotted by the enemy. Perhaps you should take a different route back to Headquarters.",

You hand her the satchel with the Golden Bars and head for the spy lounge when she asks if you have any leftover coins.  The commander sure runs a tight ship. You hand her the contents of your pocket and dash for the lounge, where you flip on the televisor, grab a controller, and return to your favorite game, [i]Spy Lords of the Multiverse[/i].\nAfter an hour that feels like an instant, you break to enjoy some fresh butter cookies and milk.

You jump over a narrow ditch and land on the raised edge of the Forgotten Trail of the Ancients.  The trail is covered in small rocks.  On occasion, you have found a few rusty 10-inch spikes, no doubt the preferred tool of the ancients for hunting.  Today the path is clear.\nWalking down the Forgotten Trail, you approach one of your favorite outposts, Sky Tower.  From there you can get the lay of the land, and watch the locals going about their business.  It occurs to you that it would be a good idea to see who is about.  You want to avoid contact with any counter agents.\nSo you climb the ladder that leads to Sky Tower and push open the trapdoor.  The tower is empty.  From its windows, you see the backside of Headquarters along with other buildings.  You also see the back of the warehouse, where people are coming and going.  Next to the warehouse is the Jewel Emporium.  Standing outside the Emporium, you spot two agents in your spy network, Bob and Angel.  They must be on a mission of their own.  The building is blocking your view, so it is difficult to make out what they are up to.\nOutside a window of Sky Tower, there is a pole that reaches to the right.

Next to the Emporium is the warehouse, the target of your mission.\nAlthough the mission is important, you cannot help but think of the untold treasures within the Emporium, and you wonder about the mission of your fellow spies.

You decide it would be best to hang below the pole, so you drop your legs down.  So far so good.  The pole gives a little as you slide farther out, just a bit more to see what’s happening.\nYour brain whirs into high gear as you realize you have gone too far and lose your grip.  As you fall, your cat-like reflexes help you twist, and when you hit the ground you roll just a bit.  Although you have prevented the worst, your left ankle took most of the weight of impact.\nKnowing defeat when it snears in your face, you hobble back to Headquarters.  The Supreme Commander pulls an ice pack from cold storage and applies it to your ankle, which is now the size of a grapefruit.  There may be a trip to the medic in your future.\nUntil then, you get to sit in front of the spy lounge televisor and play your favorite game, [i]Spy Lords of the Multiverse[/i].  Too bad you don’t have any cookies to enjoy."
