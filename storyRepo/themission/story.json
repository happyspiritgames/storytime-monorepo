You are a trusted agent of an elite spy network, and you are on a mission to recover the golden bars from a high-security warehouse in a location that you know only too well.  The mission leader has equipped you with a handful of ancient coins and notes that are used by the locals of this region to exchange for valuables.  Your mission is to enter the warehouse, locate the golden bars, bride the security guard with the coins and notes, and return to Command Central.\nShould you be captured in pursuit of your mission, there is no telling what foul consequences await you.  It is best not to be seen.  Your knack for blending in and ability to disappear in a whisper are, without a doubt, why you were chosen for this mission.\nAs you dismount the stairs that lead from headquarters to the main street, you face your first decision.  Should you play it cool and loose and head down the street directly toward your objective?  Or would it be better to sneak around to the back and take the abandoned trail of the ancients?",

A few cars pass by up and down the two-lane street.  The usual.\nOn the next block, you bump into some friends of yours, Bob and Angel.  You go to school together, but that’s not the half of it.  They are also members of the spy network.  In fact, for your last mission, the three of you invaded Sky Tower and brought back crucial intelligence that led to the take-down of The Big Ugly.  But that’s a story for another day./nToday, Bob and Angel are on a mission of their own, to liberate the Jewels of Rockland.  They invite you to join them.  The reward will be sweet.",
